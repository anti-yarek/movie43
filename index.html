            <p class="description">Ineffectual, 'has-been' film-maker (Dennis   Quaid) swindles his way into an interview with a film executive (Greg Kinnear) in order to pitch an outrageous and controversial comedy manuscript. After pitching the first of his thirteen offbeat fables, the dejected artist forces the rest of his disjointed allegory on the executive at gunpoint. He tells stories of a woman on a blind date with a man who has testicles growing from his neck, in another a smitten woman offers her neck to her boyfriend to 'poop' on -as a sign of commitment and love. In yet another two parents take home-schooling to a whole new level of indecency, striving to give their isolated teenage son all the 'regular' torment and humiliation of puberty by bullying, peer-pressuring and even seducing him themselves. An off-beat, elephant-in-the-room type film.</p>

                Every director dreams of being compared to Orson Welles. But having your new film labelled "the Citizen Kane of awful" might not be quite what Peter Farrelly had in mind. Movie 43, which opened worldwide last Friday, wasn't actually screened for critics before release. Yet a handful braved the multiplex and paid anyway. Unbuttered by PR largesse, few resisted the chance to unleash both barrels.

                "There's awful and THEN there's Movie 43," wrote Richard Roeper in the Chicago Sun-Times. For Peter Howell of the Toronto Star, it is the "worst film ever", and "biggest waste of talent in cinema history". David Edelstein offered cheery counterpoint to the chorus. "It's rare to see a piece of shit that actually looks and sounds like a piece of shit," he wrote in New York magazine. "It's kind of exciting!"

            Such a pitch of criticism is proportionate to the expectations one might entertain for a film made by the man behind There's Something About Mary and fronted by a cast which includes two of this year's Oscar nominees – Hugh Jackman and Naomi Watts – as well as the master of ceremonies (Seth MacFarlane). Other big hitters beaming from the poster include Kate Winslet, Uma Thurman, Terrence Howard, Richard Gere, Emma Stone, Liev Schreiber, Gerard Butler, Anna Faris, Johnny Knoxville, Chloë Moretz, Seann William Scott and Jason Sudeikis.

            Movie 43 unfolds as a series of skits strung together as pitches presented by a desperate screenwriter (Dennis Quaid) to a producer (Greg Kinnear). Winslet plays a woman dismayed when her date (Jackman) reveals a pair of genitals swinging from his chin. Real-life couple Faris and Chris Pratt share a sex scene in which he defecates on her face. Stephen Merchant and Halle Berry's intimate supper involves breasts plunging into guacamole. Moretz's character has her first period, which alarms her companions so much they call 911. Then a cartoon cat urinates on Elizabeth Banks.

            That the bottom has fallen out of the grossout genre is not news; what might have felt edgy in small doses in 1998 inevitably seems stale now. Likewise, ensemble comedies (remember Valentine's Day? Rat Race?) offer a notoriously dodgy template. So it's no surprise Movie 43 is no masterpiece. What has stunned critics, however, is the depth reached, and the star wattage of those plumbing it. Asks Edelstein: "Was someone holding Kate Winslet's children hostage? Threatening to release compromising pictures of Emma Stone? Did Richard Gere or Hugh Jackman have gambling debts?"

                Yet in theory you can see the logic in signing up. Many big names enjoy their biggest pay days from back-end contracts, which involve them taking a percentage of the film's profits in return for equity rates up front, and a small initial commitment (in this case, a couple of days, for about $800). If the film flies, they clean up. If it doesn't, it'll probably be buried anyway.

                It also gives A-listers the chance to show they've still got their finger on the pulse. Catching the eye of a generation more accustomed to short-form online comedy was, Farrelly has said, one of the film's aims. "With [online comedy site] Funny or Die, there are certain limits. And we just wanted to do that kind of short and go much further." (Although as box office expert Jeff Bock has said, expecting the target market to pay for such content when it's available free online is optimistic.)
